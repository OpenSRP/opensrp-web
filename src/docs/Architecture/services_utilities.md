# Services and Utilities

## Services

Services live in the src/services folder

Functionality that requires making api calls will live here

there are no strict guideliines for this section since most what will go here is free form and subject to the authors interpretation. however there are still the basic principles that are in effect globally for this porject. Here is a refresher for you.

## Utilitties

more often you will find you need to write some function (common or otherwise) to support some other functionalitty that you are working on. Such code will be placed here in the src/helpers/utils file

the tests for the same should be placed in the src/helpers/tests directory

utils is an attempt to make sure that other files only contain declarations and definitions of functions, and types that are only specific to it
